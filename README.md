# Infinite Boost

> Created by [Disky](https://github.com/Disky-mp4)

Allows you to bypass the boost recharging system (having to land your vehicle) of boost having vehicles in FiveM.

Just a fun script that I made when I was bored; I was tired of having to land to recharge while messing around on a development server. This was made overcomplicated simply for the sake of experimentation and implementing methods I recently learned.
